# Merged-video-player
This repository contains an HTML file that demonstrates how to create a video player using Video.js and add custom previous and next buttons with Font Awesome icons for navigation between videos.

## Steps for creating video.js webpage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The page will display a Video.js player with two video sources (`video1.mp4` and `video2.mp4`) defined in the `<video>` tag.
3. The player includes custom previous and next buttons with Font Awesome icons for navigating between the videos.
4. Click the previous button to switch to the previous video in the sequence.
5. Click the next button to switch to the next video in the sequence.
6. When a video ends, the player automatically switches to the next video in the sequence.
7. If the last video ends, the player loops back to the first video.
